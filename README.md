# RS_P2: Rico's Lab
A non-utiliy project that stemmed from a class, Radical Software

## Concept
The aim of Rico's Lab is to allow people to explore goofy recipes that are generated by chatGPT by giving it an item that they have in their fridge. People can also explore other goofy recipes that are generated by other people, leaving ratings, reviews and photos of their attempt at the recipe.
